# Programming question week 4, http://www.algo-class.org/ June 2012.

# The file contains the edges of a directed graph. Vertices are labeled as
# positive integers from 1 to 875714. Every row indicates an edge, the vertex
# label in first column is the tail and the vertex label in second column is
# the head (recall the graph is directed, and the edges are directed from the
# first column vertex to the second column vertex). So for example, the 11th
# row looks liks : "2 47646". This just means that the vertex with label 2 has
# an outgoing edge to the vertex with label 47646

# Your task is to code up the algorithm from the video lectures for computing
# strongly connected components (SCCs), and to run this algorithm on the given
# graph. 

# Output Format: You should output the sizes of the 5 largest SCCs in the given
# graph, in decreasing order of sizes, separated by commas (avoid any spaces).
# So if your algorithm computes the sizes of the five largest SCCs to be 500,
# 400, 300, 200 and 100, then your answer should be "500,400,300,200,100". If
# your algorithm finds less than 5 SCCs, then write 0 for the remaining terms.
# Thus, if your algorithm computes only 3 SCCs whose sizes are 400, 300, and
# 100, then your answer should be "400,300,100,0,0".

# WARNING: This is the most challenging programming assignment of the course.
# Because of the size of the graph you may have to manage memory carefully. The
# best way to do this depends on your programming language and environment, and
# we strongly suggest that you exchange tips for doing this on the discussion
# forums.
